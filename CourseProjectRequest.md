Johns Hopkins - Data Science Specialization, Module 5 Reproducible Research, Course Project 2

## Review criteria
1.Has either a (1) valid RPubs URL pointing to a data analysis document for this assignment been submitted; or (2) a complete PDF file presenting the data analysis been uploaded?

2.Is the document written in English?

3.Does the analysis include description and justification for any data transformations?

4.Does the document have a title that briefly summarizes the data analysis?

5.Does the document have a synopsis that describes and summarizes the data analysis in less than 10 sentences?

6.Is there a section titled "Data Processing" that describes how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis?

7.Is there a section titled "Results" where the main results are presented?

8.Is there at least one figure in the document that contains a plot?

9.Are there at most 3 figures in this document?

10.Does the analysis start from the raw data file (i.e. the original .csv.bz2 file)?

11.Does the analysis address the question of which types of events are most harmful to population health?

12.Does the analysis address the question of which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

13.Do all the results of the analysis (i.e. figures, tables, numerical summaries) appear to be reproducible?

14.Do the figure(s) have descriptive captions (i.e. there is a description near the figure of what is happening in the figure)?

15.As far as you can determine, does it appear that the work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it?

## Requirements
For this assignment you will need some specific tools
	•	RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.
	•	knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML.
	
	
## Document Layout

	•	Language: Your document should be written in English.
	
	•	Title: Your document should have a title that briefly summarizes your data analysis
	
	•	Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in **at most 10 complete sentences**.
	
	•	There should be a **section titled Data Processing** which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the <font color="red">cache = TRUE</font> option for certain code chunks.
	
	•	There should be a **section titled Results** in which your results are presented.
	
	•	You may have **other sections** in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
	
	•	The analysis document must have **at least one figure containing a plot**.
	
	•	Your analysis must have **no more than three figures**. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
	
	•	You **must show all your code** for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that <font color="red">echo = TRUE</font> for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
	
## Publishing Your Analysis
For this assignment you will **need to publish your analysis on RPubs.com**. If you do not already have an account, then you will have to create a new account. After you have completed writing your analysis in RStudio, you can publish it to RPubs by doing the following:

	1.	In RStudio, make sure your R Markdown document (<font color="red">.Rmd</font>) document is loaded in the editor
	
	2.	Click the <font color="red">Knit HTML</font> button in the doc toolbar to preview your document.
	
	3.	In the preview window, click the Publish button.
	
Once your document is published to RPubs, you should get a unique URL to that document.Make a note of this URL as you will need it to submit your assignment.

NOTE: If you are having trouble connecting with RPubs due to proxy-related or other issues, you can upload your final analysis document file as a PDF to Coursera instead.

## Submitting Your Assignment
In order to submit this assignment, you must copy the RPubs URL for your completed data analysis document in to the peer assessment question.

If you choose to submit as a PDF, please insert an obvious placeholder URL (e.g. [https://google.com](https://google.com) in order to allow submission.
