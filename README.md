Johns Hopkins - Data Science Specialization, Module 5 Reproducible Research, Course Project 2

## Introduction
- Provide a brief introduction to the project, its purpose, and its goals.

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.


## Data Source

**Provide a link to the data source and a brief description of the data.**

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:
	•	[Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) [47Mb]

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

	•	National Weather Service [Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)

	•	National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

## Script: [your_script_name.R]

Explain the purpose and functionality of your script. Describe each step or section it performs and how they contribute to creating the tidy dataset.

1. Step 1: Describe what was done in this step.
2. Step 2: Describe what was done in this step.
3. Step 3: Describe what was done in this step.
4. Step 4: Describe what was done in this step.

## Dependencies

List any dependencies or packages required to run the script.

- Dependency 1
- Dependency 2

## How to use the script

Explain how to use the script, including any dependencies, how to set the working directory, and how to run the script.

1. Download and unzip the dataset.
2. Set the working directory to the folder containing the dataset.
3. Ensure the required packages are installed in R or RStudio.
4. Run the `[your_script_name.R]` script.

## Output

Describe the output of the script, i.e., the tidy dataset, and how it can be used for further analysis.

## Additional Files

Mention the Codebook.md and its purpose in the repository.

- `Codebook.md`: Describes the variables, data, and transformations performed to clean up the data.
